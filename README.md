# Recommendation Systems

This material is based on this [Alura course](https://cursos.alura.com.br/course/introducao-a-sistemas-de-recomendacao-com-python).

The material from course is implemented using Jupyter Notebooks, but here I implement a variation using only python and a different project structure. The goal is to implement my own version of KNN to recommend movies to a user.

The data-source can be obtained [here](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/). The small dataset is included on this repository, but the full dataset must be downloaded separately.
